Overview
This project is about creating your own version of an ArrayList in Java — a type of list that can grow in size as you add more items. It works with any kind of object (like Strings, Integers, etc.) because it uses Java Generics.

What This List Can Do
Store any type of item you choose (thanks to <T>).
Automatically make more space when it runs out.
Lets you add or remove items by index (like at the beginning, middle, or end).
Use fast built-in Java tools to move or copy items when needed.
Includes handy methods like:
addFirst() and addLast() to add items at the start or end.
removeFirst() and removeLast() to take items off from the start or end.
You can search the list to check if something’s there (contains()), or find where it is (indexOf()).
You can clear the whole list with clear().
All of these features are tested using JUnit to make sure they work properly.
